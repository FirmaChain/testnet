The FirmaChain testnet is a space where chain developers prepare for a variety of scenarios and specifications, providing the fastest way to check for updates to the FirmaChain Core.

The Imperium DevNet consists of 3 validators and 1 light node and is used to test the developing chain module and the basic Cosmos & Tendermint features like validator test and staking, delegation, and voting.

This repository also manages the config file and genesis.json required to set up the chain.
